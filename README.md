# Interpolation-Search-Python

Note : 
	- Data must be sorted.
	- Data must be sequential Ex. 1 3 5 7 // Differance between each element 2.
	
How it works ?
- Assume that you have one book with 500 pages. 
  
  CASE 1 :
	someone tells you to open page no.400 
	So In this case You definitely turn your books pages from the end.
	
 
  CASE 2 :
	someone tells you to open page no.20 
	So In this case You definitely turn your books pages from the start.
	
	
Why this algo ?
- It works more efficient than Binary Search.


Note :
If your data is not sorted and not sequential Still my Code work Perfectly.
